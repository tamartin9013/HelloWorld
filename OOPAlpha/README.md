This program, while incomplete for now because I have fallen behind in my understanding of connecting the seperate components of the project, is intended to output a text label with necessary production line information. It is supposed to output the manufacturer, serial number, date, and name. I am continually working on this project, and consequently catching up in my knowledge. If I have the opportunity to re-submit before the project is graded I will do so, but otherwise I understand where my current submission stands on the grading scale and I will use the remaining class time to recover and learn from this mistake.
